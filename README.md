# The Racketears Website
[View the live project here.](https://emilija-smitaite.github.io/milestone-project-1/)

This is the official website for a retired rock band The Racketears. As the band is no longer active, this website serves as a way to share their artwork and keep in contact with their fans.  The website is easy to use and responsive. In the future playlist would be a desired addition to the gallery page.

## Design

  #### **Colour scheme**
  - The main two colours are black and a shade of mustard yellow.
  #### **Typography**
  - Roboto font is the main used across the website, Sans Serif as the fallback. Roboto is a popular font in web development that is attractive, pleasant and professional looking. The logo is styled using Road Rage font, Sans Serif as the fallback. A striking, impactful, untidy font is ideal for a rock band. The extremely decorative font is suitable for a logo but is not used anywhere else on a website.
  #### **Imagery**
  - Hero image contains band members to help identify the band. Rustic, aged, film photography hints at the time music was produced in the early 2000s. The Colour scheme matches the rest of the website.

## Further testing
* The Website was tested on Google Chrome and Safari browsers.
* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8, iPhone 7 plus, iPhone 8 plus, iPad, iPad pro, Galaxy S5.
* A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
* Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

## Bugs
* I was using column-count property to organise photos into two columns on the gallery page. However, when using media queries to organise photos into four columns for larger screen sizes, the column-count property was overridden by the original count of two. This was solved by adding !important rule.
