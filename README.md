# The Racketears Website
[View the live project here.](https://emilija-smitaite.github.io/milestone-project-1/)

This is the official website for a retired rock band The Racketears. As the band is no longer active, this website serves as a way to share their artwork and keep contact with their fans.  Website is easy to use and responsive. In the future playlist would be a desired addition to the gallery page.

## Design

  #### **Colour scheme**
  - The main two colours are black and a shade of mustard yellow.
  #### **Typography**
  - Roboto font is the main used across the website , Sans Serif as the fallback. Roboto is   a popular font in web development which is attractive, pleasant and professional looking. Logo is styled using Road Rage font. Striking, impactful, untidy font is ideal for a rock band. Extremely decorative font is suitable for a logo but is not used anywhere else on a website.
  #### **Imagery**
  - Hero image contains band members to help identify the band. Rustic, aged, film photography hints to the time music was produced in early 2000s. Colour scheme matches the rest of the website.
